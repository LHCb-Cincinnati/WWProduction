This is an old version of the UCincy LHCb WW analysis.  This space is now used for standalone GenLevelStudies.  For the current analysis code visit [this gitlab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/LHCb-QEE/dileptonww), and for more information on the analysis visit [this CodiMD](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/QJdKyqZRSpq93XYVUlftpQ#).

The programs in this repository are meant to be run inside GenLevelStudies.  For example:
`python3 madgraph/analysis.py input_file.root`
